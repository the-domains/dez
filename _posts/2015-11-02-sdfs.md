I don't think so - here's why: machines can only _mimic_ human spontaneity & creativity.

**Spontaneity:**

The state of acting on impulses, movements,

or

actions

...which originate from hidden, and subconscious processes.

And my guess is that these hidden, subconscious processes are pretty much _unique _to each individual, based on the sum of their memories, dreams, experiences and relationships.

Sure - machines might be able to _mimic_ these, but I believe they'll always be a _synthetic version _of the real thing.
